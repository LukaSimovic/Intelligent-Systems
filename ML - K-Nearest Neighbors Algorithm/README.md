#  K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The goal of the project task is the realization of a model for estimating the state of a car (unacceptable, acceptable, good or very good) using the algorithm of K-nearest neighbors.

The project follows the following steps:
1. Loading the data set and displaying the first and last five rows in the table.
2. Presentation of concise information on the content of the table and statistical information on all attributes.
3. Graphical representation of the dependence of the output attribute on each input attribute scattering points according to the Cartesian coordinate system.
4. Selection of attributes that participate in model training.
5. Perform additional transformations on the table data.
6. Realization of the k-nearest neighbor model using its own implementation algorithm.
7. Realization of the k-nearest neighbor model using some of the built-in models (***sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier*** is used).
